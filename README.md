# Research-Methods-FYP-idea-Crop-Yield-Prediction-Model-

This is a research idea for my Final Year Project so it's documented only without coding. This project is based on Crop Yield Prediction Model that applies several algorithms to ensure the predictions are made at best accuracy and available to be used in rural areas with poor internet access by farmers. This model takes into account of several factors like crop type, environmental conditions like rainfall, and more. 

Technologies to use to build the model are:
Machine Learning: DT, RF, KNN, XGB, SVM
Programming: Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Tkinter)
Data Sources: IoT sensor data, public agricultural datasets
Deployment: Desktop-based, with scalable architecture

It is further explained about the system purpose in the documents.

The zip file containing tutorials are small tasks that I performed.
